and existing metals, most notably their liquid forms.

## üîß Features

<details>
    <summary>Molten Metals</summary>
    <p>Create: Blazing Hot adds molten variants of metals to the game. Currently, only Gold and Blaze Gold have their liquid forms, but more will be added in the future.</p>
    <p>There are new <b>filling recipes</b> using Molten Gold for <b>Golden Carrots, Glistering Melons and Golden Apples.</b></p>
    <p>Molten metals can also interact with Water:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Molten Gold</b> turns into Cobblestone, but it's way faster than Lava.</li>
        <li><b>Molten Blaze</b> Gold turns into Netherrack.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Blaze Gold</summary>
    <p>This new alloy is the main part of the mod. It is obtained by mixing <b>Molten Gold</b> and a new ingredient - <b>Nether Essence</b>. Blaze Gold is used in various recipes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crushing Blaze Gold Rods has a chance of dropping <b>Blaze Powder</b>, allowing for easy automation of it.</li>
        <li>Blaze Gold Rods are also used in the crafting of <b>Modern Lamps</b> - a new block to light up your builds, and <b>Blaze Arrows</b> - a new type of arrow that deals extra damage when shot in The Nether dimension!</li>
        <li>Either Blaze Gold Nuggets or Molten Blaze Gold can be used to craft <b>Blaze Carrots</b>, which stop the player from burning on being eaten.</li>
        <li>Molten Blaze Gold can be used to craft <b>new variants of Apples</b>, that give longer Fire Resistance effect and Strength.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More features for Blaze Gold are planned, such as Blaze Casings and some new machinery!</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Nether Compound and Nether Essence</summary>
    <p><b>Nether Compound</b> can be obtained by mixing some Overworld and Nether materials together. It can be haunted into the <b>Nether Essence</b>. Currently, it's only used in the Blaze Gold recipe, but there is more content planned for these items.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Food</summary>
    <p>This mod adds <b>new Apple and Carrot variants</b>. The metal variants are crafted from Ingots and Nuggets respectively, or by <b>filling with Molten Metals</b>. Each metal has its own stats and effects.<br>Metal Apples can be later upgraded into their <b>Stellar</b> forms by deploying a <b>Nether Star</b> on them.<br>In Sequenced Assembly, Stellar Apples can be turned into their <b>Enchanted</b> forms. </p> 
    <p>Currently, you can make Carrots and Apples out of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Gold</b> (like in Vanilla, but with the addition of the Stellar variant)</li>
        <li><b>Blaze Gold</b> (focused on Damage and Fire Resistance)</li>
        <li><b>Iron</b> (focused on Defence)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>There is more food planned in the future for other metals.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

There is more content planned for the future as the mod is actively being developed.

## üî® Forge support and older versions

There **may** be support for Forge in the future, but I don't guarantee anything.<br>
Support for older Minecraft versions (before 1.20.1) is not planned.
