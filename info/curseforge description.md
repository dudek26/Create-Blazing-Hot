* * *

üîß Features
-----------

### New fluids

Create: Blazing Hot adds molten variants of metals to the game. Currently, only Iron, Gold and Blaze Gold have their liquid forms, but more will be added in the future.

Blocks, ingots, sheets and nuggets can be slowly melted in superheated Mixing or in superheated Blaze Mixing

There are new **filling recipes** using Molten Gold for **Golden Carrots, Glistering Melons and Golden Apples.**

Molten Blaze Gold generates **Netherrack** when touching lava.

There is also a new Lava variant: **Nether Lava**. It behaves exactly like Lava in the Nether, granting the possibility of creating faster Cobblestone generators!

### Blaze Gold

This new alloy is the main part of the mod. It is obtained by mixing **Molten Gold** and a new ingredient - **Nether Essence**. Blaze Gold is used in various recipes:

*   Crushing Blaze Gold Rods has a chance of dropping **Blaze Powder**, allowing for easy automation of it.
*   Blaze Gold Rods are also used in the crafting of **Modern Lamps** - a new block to light up your builds, and **Blaze Arrows** - a new type of arrow that deals extra damage when shot in The Nether dimension!
*   Either Blaze Gold Nuggets or Molten Blaze Gold can be used to craft **Blaze Carrots**, which stop the player from burning on being eaten.
*   Molten Blaze Gold can be used to craft **new variants of Apples**, that give longer Fire Resistance effect and Strength.

### Blaze Mixing

Using Blaze Gold, you can upgrade Copper Casings to **Blaze Casings**. They can be later used to craft a new machine - the **Blaze Mixer**:

*   When there is no fuel inside, the Blaze Mixer behaves exactly like the Mechanical Mixer.
*   If the mixer is fueled (by default, the fuel can be either Lava or Nether Lava) it works **twice as fast** as the Mechanical Mixer, and melting metals is five times faster.
*   There are also some recipes **exclusive to Blaze Mixer**, such as the Nether Lava recipe or more efficient Molten Blaze Gold and melting recipes.

_Currently, there is no support for Roughly Enough Items (REI). Use EMI or JEI if you want to view the recipes._

### Nether Compound and Nether Essence

**Nether Compound** can be obtained by mixing some Overworld and Nether materials together. It can be haunted into the **Nether Essence**. Currently, it's only used in the Blaze Gold recipe, but there is more content planned for these items.

### Food

This mod adds **new Apple and Carrot variants**. The metal variants are crafted from Ingots and Nuggets respectively, or by **filling with Molten Metals**. Each metal has its own stats and effects.  
Metal Apples can be later upgraded into their **Stellar** forms by deploying a **Nether Star** on them.  
In Sequenced Assembly, Stellar Apples can be turned into their **Enchanted** forms.

Currently, you can make Carrots and Apples out of:

*   **Gold** (like in Vanilla, but with the addition of the Stellar variant)
*   **Blaze Gold** (focused on Damage and Fire Resistance)
*   **Iron** (focused on Defence)
*   There is more food planned in the future for other metals.

There is more content planned for the future as the mod is actively being developed.
